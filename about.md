## About me <small>Julien Bourdeau</small>

Hello I'm Julien Bourdeau and I love open source.

I'm now an open source developer at [PrestaShop][3]. PrestaShop is an ecommerce software that power about
250 000 online stores. You can have a look at the project [on GitHub][4]. My job is mostly about maintaining
the project with the community, adding new features and debugging.

Before that I went to study Electronics and Computer Sciences at *[ESEO][1]*, my Engineering School in France. Then in
2010-11, I moved to Hong Kong to study at *[City University Of Hong Kong][2]*. There, I had the
opportunity to travel all around Asia (Philippines, Thailand, China, Japan, Vietnam,...) and meet so
many people. An amazing life experience, definitely unforgettable.

Once I got my Master in *Multimedia Information Technology*, I went back to France and started to work
as a *Junior Consultant* for IBM. I worked there for few months then I went back to my home
town - Nantes - to start my own business.

I cofounded "*CÃ´telettes &amp; Tarte aux Fraises*" which brought e-commerce and cross-canal to small
shops (like a butchers, grocery shop, cheese shop,...). After about a year and half we decided that the
results weren't satisfying so I got this great job at PrestaShop.
