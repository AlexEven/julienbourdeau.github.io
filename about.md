## About me <small>Julien Bourdeau</small>

Hello I'm Julien Bourdeau and I quite love computers.

I went to study Electronics and Cumputer Sciences at *[ESEO](http://www.eseo.fr/international/international-relations/)*, my Engineering School in France. Yeah, in France we go to a sort of school for this, not uni, it's complicated. But at the end your 5 years you still get a Master degree.

In 2010-11, I went to Hong Kong to study at *[City University Of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/)*. There, I had the opportunity to travel all around Asia (Philippines, Thailand, China, Japan, Vietnam,...) and meet so many people. An amazing life experience, definitely unforgettable.

Once I got my Master in *Multimedia Information Technology*, I went back to France and started to work as a *Business Intelligence Junior Consultant* for IBM. I worked there for few months then I went back to my home town - Nantes - to start my own business.

I cofounded "*Côtelettes &amp; Tarte aux Fraises*" which brought e-commerce and cross-canal to small shops (like a butchers, grocery shop, cheese shop,...). Get your quality french food online: [www.cotelettes-tarteauxfraises.com](http://www.cotelettes-tarteauxfraises.com). After about a year and half we decided that the results weren't satisfying I get a new job.

I'm now a core developer at [PrestaShop](http://www.prestashop.com/). PrestaShop is an ecommerce plateform that power about 200 000 online stores. You can have a look at the project [on this page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop).
