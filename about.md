## About me <small>Julien Bourdeau</small>

Hey,

I'm now working at [Algolia][2] as software engineer. I'm doing my best to enable
the PHP community to build amazing search experience based on Algolia.

Before that I was building an open source ecommerce software named [PrestaShop][1].
My job was mostly about maintaining the project with the community, adding new
features and debugging.

I studied Electronics and Computer Sciences at *[ESEO][1]*, in France. Then in
2010, I moved to Hong Kong for about a year.
