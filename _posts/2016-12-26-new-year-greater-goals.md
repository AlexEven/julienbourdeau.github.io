Last year I wrote down what my goals were for the coming year and it turns out to be a fantastic way to describe precisely what I really wanted.
After reviewing my successes and failures, I think this year I'm going to do a better job of setting new year resolutions.

If you want it to work, you have to be focused, hence you can't have too many goals. I'm going to define only 3 but from a higher point of view compared to last year.



<h2><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Write, write and write again</h2>

It was already in the list last year. I said that I wanted to publish at least one great article, which shouldn't be hard in 12 months, but I failed.

Now that I'm reading much more, I want to write. I always liked it but I'm really not good at artistic stuff.

By writing, I mean that I want to actually produce contents but also improve my skills a lot. If you ever read something I wrote in French, you'll be freaked out by the unbelievable amount of mistakes I make: grammar, conjugation and spelling. I know I do a lot in English too, but at least I have an excuse: it's not my native language.

My primary goal is to improve my writing *in English*. Maybe French will come later. The main reason is that I work in English, not in French but I also have this feeling that English is easier that French. Try learning French conjugation if you don't believe me.

Even if I always knew writing was important, I never really understood why. In class, they will tell you that it's important so you don't look dumb at work or among your friends. Honestly, I couldn't care less.

I fully understood how important it is by reading Joel Spolsky's articles and 37signals' book (*Rework* and *Remote*). They both consider writing as one of the most important skills and they explained it to me in a way that made me click. To summarise: **clear writing means clear thinking**.



<h2><i class="fa fa-medkit"></i>  Become an athlete</h2>

Yeah I know, that's very pretentious. I wrote here how I got into losing weight and exercising and how it makes me feel much better.

Last year I said I wanted to *"get back to the gym"*, *"eat better"* or *"sleep more"*. All those things are actually related, it's about being healthier so your body doesn't stop you from doing something you want to do.

I like the way *Jeff Cavaliere* put it: I want to **get out of the *diet and exercising* spirit and get into the *nutrition and training* one**. I don't know if you get the difference I'm pointing here, if you don't, you should [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k47Ho4cufNc).

My way of saying it is: **have a greater goal**. For example this year I decided to run a full marathon. I don't particularly enjoy running or going to the gym to do cardio but since I have this goal I do it anyway. At the time of writing, it's winter, it's cold and rainy, it's very hard to find motivation to go out and run but I do it anyway because I get motivation and pleasure in my greater goal. I hope you get me.

The other thing is that I will have to watch even more what I eat, and especially, what I drink. I'll probably quit beer. :cry:



<h2><i class="fa fa-code"></i>  Be amazing at my new job</h2>

After 3 years at PrestaShop, I'm moving to a new adventure and I am very excited about it. The product is great and leading its market but even better, the company is everything I wanted. They built their culture based on the book [*Freedom Inc*](https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Inc-Employees-Business-Productivity/dp/0307409384/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1482766731&sr=1-1&keywords=freedom+inc) which develop the idea that people do a better job when they care and when they're freed from micro-management.

I'll pour everything I have in this job and I believe in return, it will make me a better engineer and a better coworker in the end. Basically, a better person.

I can't even express how excited I am about this new opportunity. I will write later here about it.

Game on.
