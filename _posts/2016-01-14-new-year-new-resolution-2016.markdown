In 2015, my life has changed a lot and I got into thinking about what I want get done.
I feel like days are flying and I still didn't even start some project I had in mind
for years. I won't describe the projects here, I just want to write about the changes
I expect in my _"way of life"_.

I'm publishing the list, so if you get to read this and meet me in real life,
you can publicly shame me if I failed. :smirk:


<h2><i class="fa fa-medkit"></i> Eat better & go to the gym</h2>

Let's get this one out of the way. Every year, we all say that but to be fair I already
started last year. I lost weight and I'm going to the gym at least once a week.
I want to take it even further next year. It's quite complicated to lose weight
when you drink as much beer as me.


<h2><i class="fa fa-music"></i> Go back to small shows</h2>

When I was younger, in Nantes, I used to attend to a lot of shows, most of the time I didn't
even know the bands. Facebook wasn't big yet so you had to go the best forum ever:
[NantesMonAmour.com](http://www.nantesmonamour.com). Basically I was going to see
any kind of rock music (metal, punk, hxc and so on) but in the end I was going
to see the same local bands over and over ! (but I loved it)

In Paris, I mostly go to bigger shows and now I really want to go back to smaller ones.


<h2><i class="fa fa-bed"></i> Rise early and sleep more</h2>

After I came back from Hong Kong, I spent 6 month working for IBM in Grenoble.
Since I didn't know anyone I didn't go out much, hence spent a lot of time
with my computer (#lame). I started getting up about 6:00am when I only had to
leave for work at 8:30am. I was getting soooo much done by 8, it felt really good.
I think now I should try again.

Also, the older I get, the less productive I am at night.


<h2><i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> Build stuff</h2>

I have a lot of things in mind I want to build. My friends got me an _ardruino
stater kit_ last year but I never took the time to play with it. 2016, I will !

I also got a new electric screwdriver to work on home improvements. Well, this, we will
see how it goes.


<h2><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Write more</h2>

I enjoy the time I spend in front of my keyboard writing about whatever like I used to do
before [on my blog](). I think it's a very good way to take the time to think.

I intend to write here (probably about PrestaShop and Symfony), I want to write
on [build](http://build.prestashop.com) (definitely about PrestaShop). And this year
I want to get one article published on medium.com. I still have no idea what about tho.


<h2><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Encrypt everything</h2>

Sometimes I connect to public wifiwithout VPN.
I use dropbox for banking documents.
I use _Facebook messenger_ and _Google Hangout_.

You get me, I want to encrypt my files and conversations, stop using crappy software/service
and secure my personal data.

That's it! I guess I'll write about what I got done (or not) by the end of this.
