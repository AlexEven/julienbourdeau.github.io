question: How to install Google play (ex Android Market) on MPMAN Tablet
question-desc: |
    I have a cheap Android tablet, an MPMAN MID74C. The problem is: it doesn't come with Android Market, I mean Google Play now. Instead of Google Play, MPMAN chose to pre-install GetJar.

    First thing I wanted to do: install Google play on my new MPMAN Tablet.

My Tablet isÂ **MID74C** but I had confirmation that it works on many other similar tablet.

Also, my apologies but the 2 screenshots below are in french, I'm sure it won't be a problem.

### _Step 1_: Download the following file

Use the button below to download the APK file for **Google Play**.

### _Step 2_: Unzip the file

I would advise you to use 7zip if you are a Windows' user.

Transfer all the file on your **MPMAN tablet**. I used the SD Card but you can also do it with the USB cable.

### _Step 3_: Install these files

Now use your file manager on your MPMAN tablet and find the folder where you copied the 4 files. You only have to open them to install them, **that will finish the installation of Google Play on MPMAN tablet**.

You have to follow a specific order to open them:

1. GoogleServiceFramework.apk **read note below**
1. OneTimeInitializer.apk
1. SetupWizard.apk
1. com.android.vending-3.1.3-signed.apk

<div class='alert alert-warning'>
**Careful**: You may have a message saying that a version of the file is already installed. In this case, just click cancel and move forward.
</div>
