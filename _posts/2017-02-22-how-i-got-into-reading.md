All my life I have never been interested in books. I couldn't find the motivation to sit and read something for so long. When everybody was into Harry Potter, I think I was about 13 years old, so I tried to read it. I read all the way to the page twenty-something and gave up. I couldn't care less about this kid leaving under the stairs.

I was all right with it and never planned to try reading, but something happened. I realized that I would soon be turning 30. About a year ago I started thinking A LOT about what I've done in my life and what I want to do. Kind of middle age crisis, but a decade too early.

### Motivation

The project I was working on at work was late and getting annoying. I didn't feel like I was learning much at this time. Plus, we were moving from small independent feature team to a whole Agileâ„¢ team (more on that in another post).

I remember than when I was younger I read _"[The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357)"_. To be honest, I was 20, I read it in English, and at this time, I probably didn't understand much. So I thought I should read it again.

It clicked! I was feeling so motivated while reading Tim Ferriss! Almost like I could do anything I wanted, that it was possible.

If you're European, you might view (American) self-development as a sect kinda thing, where desperate people go to conventions to seek answers. This is partly true, but I would still encourage you to try one.

### Improve yourself

After this, I thought about his following book _"[The 4-Hour Body](https://www.amazon.com/Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X)"_. When it came out, I found it stupid and didn't believe any of what my friend was telling me about this book. I was wrong. I read it (partially since it's 700+ pages long) and lost about 5 kilos (11 lbs) in May and put the weight back on.

5 kilos might not seem much, but since I'm not very tall, it makes a big difference. I was feeling so much better that in July I decided to run the next Paris Marathon.

Another example. A dear friend advised me to read _"[The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](https://www.amazon.fr/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308)"_ and I did. My apartment has never been so clean. I have thrown away SO MUCH, and I'm triumphal about it.

### Learn and grow

Like I said earlier, at some point I didn't feel like I was becoming a better programmer. Learning through books is one of the best ways to learn, I believe this is as important as practicing.

You can learn almost everything in a book, not just programming. I love reading books like _"[The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.amazon.fr/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205)"_ because it gives me the opportunity to take quiet time think (I oppose it to reading an article).

Another great book I read this past year is _"[The Cathedral & the Bazaar](https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0596001088)"_, about how Linus Torvalds revolutionize the software industry.

In the end, I still don't read fiction. I still believe I can spend my time in a better way but this because to me; reading is more about work than about entertainment.

Considering what I like, is there any book you'd recommend me?
