Last year I took some strong new year resolutions and I want to stop and think to review them.

I've come a long way and changed a lot in the past year, even if all goals aren't achieved.


<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Eat better & go to the gym: Success</h3>


This one is definitely my biggest achievement this year. I subscribed to a gym for the first time in 2014, I went a few times but it basically paid one year subscription to go 12 times... Like many people. After that I subscribed to a new gym, it was cheaper, closer and has a national presence. But the main difference is that this time I subscribed with a friend. I started going with him twice or thrice a week, to do a lot of cardio and some muscle growth.

At the beginning of this year 2016, I realised that since I started to go to the gym regularly I actually put on weight! The reason is simple: I was still eating badly.

At the same time, I reread my favourite book - the 4 hours workweek - and I knew what I needed: the four-hour body! Of course. I got it and read (partly) in April. I went for 4 serious weeks of _slow carb diet_ in May (plus 2 not so serious weeks in June) and I lost more about 4,5 kilos. I didn't hit the gym, not even once in about 2 months and guess what. I got far better results in 1 month of diet than in 1 year of exercising!

By now I have read and watched a lot about diet and what, how and when I should eat. Of course losing the belly fat I got for years will require an incredible amount of effort but I am now in a state of mind where I'm ready to do what it takes to be lean. I get more satisfaction from that than eating crap.

And there is more. In July, after a top manager at PrestaShop realised he was 10 years older than most of the team, he made a remark: _"I may be the oldest but I'm the only one who runs marathons here"_. It was Friday the 8th. I kept thinking about it. On Saturday I checked the dates for the _marathon of Paris_. It was in early April which left me 9 months to prepare. I thought I should try! I tried to motivate a friend to do it with me so I go and ask around. Most of the time I didn't get the answer I wanted but things like:

- _"you cant prepare a marathon in 9 months when you never ever ran for real in your life"_
- _"start slowly try a 10k or a 20k race first, then you will see for next year"_
- _"don't be silly, start running and you will see how much you like it before committing to such an effort."_

**I know it's childish (or even pretentious) but the more people told me it was stupid or impossible the more I wanted to do it.**

On Sunday morning that was it. I knew I was going to do it! I registered for a [20k race in Paris](http://www.20kmparis.com/). I completed it in 1h52m which is a fairly good performance. And now I did take my ticket for the marathon of Paris, it will be on April 9th and I'm doing everything it takes to finish it in less than 5 hours.




<h3><i class="fa fa-spinner"></i> Encrypt everything: In progress</h3>

This takes time, I'm slowly switching to SpiderOak ( I got an unlimited plan). I got a VPN subscription at ProXPN (hidemyass was definitely to expensive).

Fortunately, WhatsApp and Facebook messenger got encryption this year but this has nothing to do with me.


<h3><i class="fa fa-times"></i> Write more: Fail</h3>

I blatantly failed at this one. I wrote approximately nothing over the past 12 months. It's mostly due to a lack of time and since I'm not an artist, creative work like writing is not easy for me. It takes a lot of effort. Although, I have read more in one year that I have ever read in my life.

I started with my favourite book, the four hours workweek, which gave me motivation for everything else.

Some of my reading this year:

* Modernizing legacy PHP application
* The four-hour body
* Rich dad, poor Dad
* Who
* The hard thing about the hard thing
* Joel on software
* Rework

Also, I tend to read 70-80% of most books. There is only a few of them I read entirely. I think I just get too excited to move the next book. Plus I'm developing this habit of not finishing things that don't matter. Like before I would force myself to finish a season of a TV series I started, for the sake of it. I don't care anymore, I'm pretty proud of not finishing stuff.



<h3><i class="fa fa-spinner"></i> Rise early and sleep more: In progress</h3>

I haven't been very consistent with this one although I very often wake up between 5 and 6:30 to get some personal project done. I like the morning more and more but I'm struggling at going to bed on time. I usually go to bed too late or go out so it's hard to keep the habit of getting up early. I'll keep working on this one.



<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Going back to small shows: Success</h3>

I went to a show alone, for the first time of my life. That was a very small show in _Caf√© de Paris_ and I think the band was [Reduction](http://www.last.fm/music/Reduction). I'm pretty happy with the shows I attended to this year, I'll carry this one next year.



<h3><i class="fa fa-times"></i> Build stuff: Fail</h3>

Let's be honest, when I wrote the list last year I knew it was a lot to do only one year. I like having a lot in my plates and that's usually when I'm the most productive so it felt right to target a lot. And I'm not making up excuses to justify I failed this one ;)

I have a great project for next year, I'll publish more about it (goals, source code...)


## Next year

I already have a lot in mind for next year! I'm excited to take more new resolutions that I will publish here.
